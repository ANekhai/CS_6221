# Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Neural Network in Haskell

The repository contains a neural network written from scratch on Haskell, with accompanying Flask app that allows a user to draw a digit to be predicted on. Some features of the project include: 

1. Feed forward neural network using 2 layers 
2. Backpropagation algorithm 
3. Gradient descrent using the AD package
4. Image conversion using JuicyPixels and HIP libraries
5. Flask app and deployment to Heroku
